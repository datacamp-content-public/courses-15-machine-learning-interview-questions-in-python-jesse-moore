Great job, you've made it to the final question on data preperation. 

In this video, you'll learn how to answer interview questions on preparing time-series data for machine learning.

## Time Series Data

center_content: false

- Time series data is time-ordered, typically in even spaces of time{{2}}

- Needs to be handled in a special way when preparing training and validation data{{3}}


`@script`
Time series data is a special type of data.

One of the most obvious examples of time-series data is the stock market. The prices in the previous days are very predictive of the prices today.

Due to this chronological nature, time series data needs to be handled in a special way. 

Thus, when preparing training and validation sets we need to be very cognizant of the potential pitfalls and understand how to deal with them.

There are many variations of questions on time series data, but the concept behind them remains the same.

## The Concept Behind Preparing Time Series Data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e1acbe2e36"
```

`@part1`
- Random sampling assumes there is no relationship between data points{{1}}
- Be careful to avoid "Look-ahead" bias {{2}}

`@script`
Imagine an example where you did not build a training and validation set in the right way. You have simply randomly selected rows to train and validate on.

In this case, your algorithm could determine from some of the features in the dataset to "Look Ahead".

It is best to think of what an algorithm might do as fingerprinting.

Let's say you are making a prediction today which is June 20th. 

You want to predict what will happen tomorrow on the 21st, but because you have not dealt with the chronological nature of the time-series data, your algorithm is able to find the results from June 26th and 'cheat' with information that it would otherwise not have.

The result would be an algorithm that tests very well, but fails in practice. 

When the algorithm goes live it is not privy to the future information it has become accustomed to using. 

The effect of this varies from dataset to dataset, but the concept remains the same. Do not give your algorithm future information!
