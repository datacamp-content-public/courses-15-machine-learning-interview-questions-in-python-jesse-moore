- Time series data is time-ordered, typically in even spaces of time{{2}}

- Needs to be handled in a special way when preparing training and validation data{{3}}


`@script`
Time series data is a special type of data.

One of the most obvious examples of time-series data is the stock market. The prices in the previous days are very predictive of the prices today.

Due to this chronological nature, time series data needs to be handled in a special way. 

Thus, when preparing training and validation sets we need to be very cognisant of the potential pitfalls and understand how to deal with them.
